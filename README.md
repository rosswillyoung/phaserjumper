Simple Jumper Game I'm creating to test out Phaser and brush up on JavaScript/Github

- [x] Add ground and sky
- [x] Add platforms
- [x] Add Sprite
- [x] Jumping and moving mechanism for sprite
- [x] Animation frames for sprite
- [x] Auto-generate platforms
- [x] Remove off-screen platforms
- [x] Collision detection just for top of platform
- [x] Scroll speed temporarily higher when player is above a certain height
    - [x] Need to keep in mind platform creation
    - [ ] Higher scroll speed depending on how much higher the player is than the defined height
- [ ] Update platform creation to be better (more varied height and widths)
    - [ ] smaller platforms as time goes on
    - [ ] breakable platforms?
- [x] Set scroll speed higher as time goes on
- [x] Game pause until first ^ press
- [ ] Power-ups
- [ ] Score (positive scrollY * 10?) 
- [ ] Shooting mechanism
- [ ] Enemies
- [ ] Score
- [ ] Pre-and-post game scenes
- [ ] Create custom artwork and replace default Phaser Art
